Current law also allows, but does not require,&nbsp;CMS to make such adjustments with respect to certain orthotics (such as splints and braces) and parenteral and enteral nutrients, equipment, and supplies (such as feeding tubes).&nbsp;The bill requires CMS, in making&nbsp;these adjustments, to account for&nbsp;stakeholder input. In addition, CMS must account for a comparison of competitive acquisition areas and other areas with respect to the following factors:</p> <ul> <li>average travel distance and cost associated with furnishing items and services, </li> <li>average volume of items and services furnished by suppliers, and </li> <li>number of suppliers.</li> </ul> <p>TITLE XVII--OTHER MEDICARE PROVISIONS</p> <p> (Sec. 17001) Until plan year 2019, CMS may not terminate a Medicare Advantage (MA) plan solely because the plan failed to achieve a specified minimum quality rating.</p> <p>(Sec. 17002) CMS&nbsp;must annually report on specified Medicare enrollment data.</p> <p>(Sec. 17003) CMS&nbsp;shall: (1) request information and recommendations from stakeholders on information included in the&nbsp;Welcome to Medicare package, and (2)&nbsp;update the information included in the&nbsp;package accordingly.</p> <p> (Sec. 17004) Current law allows&nbsp;CMS to impose a temporary moratorium on the enrollment of new providers under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) if necessary to combat fraud, waste, or abuse. With specified exceptions, the bill prohibits payment under these programs to new providers in areas subject to such temporary moratorium.</p> <p> (Sec. 17005) The bill expands and modifies enrollment and disenrollment options for MA-eligible individuals. Specifically, the bill extends the annual period in which an individual enrolled in MA may elect to instead receive benefits under the original Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) program as well as elect to change qualified prescription drug coverage. Furthermore, any MA-eligible individual (whether or not enrolled in MA) may once per period change a previous election with respect to receiving benefits through MA or Medicare FFS, including changing from one MA plan to another. Unsolicited marketing during this period is prohibited.</p> <p> (Sec. 17006) The bill allows individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) to be eligible for MA. Under current law, only individuals who develop ESRD while already enrolled in an MA plan may be considered eligible.</p> <p>With respect to payment, the bill: (1) shifts responsibility for the cost of kidney acquisitions from MA plans to Medicare's&nbsp;FFS program, and (2)&nbsp;excludes&nbsp;such costs&nbsp;from the calculation of certain benchmarks that&nbsp;form the basis for payment under MA plans.</p> <p>CMS must conduct, and post online the results of, an evaluation of whether to include in a plan's quality rating a measure specifically related to care for MA enrollees with ESRD.</p> <p>The bill also modifies risk adjustment with respect to MA plans.

(The program enables ACOs to receive payments for savings stemming from care coordination and management.)</p> <p>Specifically, the bill requires the basis for assignment to reflect beneficiaries' utilization of not only primary care services provided by ACO physicians, but also those furnished in federally qualified health centers or rural health clinics.</p> <p>TITLE XVIII--OTHER PROVISIONS</p> <p> (Sec. 18001) This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), and other laws to exempt qualified small employer health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs) from certain requirements that apply to group health plans. </p> <p>A qualified small employer HRA is offered by employers that have fewer than 50 full-time employees and do not offer group health plans to any of their employees. A qualified small employer HRA must: </p> <ul> <li>be provided on the same terms to all eligible employees of the employer; </li> <li>be funded solely by the employer without salary reduction contributions; </li> <li>provide, after an employee provides proof of coverage, for the payment or reimbursement of medical expenses of the employee and family members; and </li> <li>limit annual payments and reimbursements to specified dollar amounts. </li> </ul> <p>HRAs that meet these requirements are not considered group health plans and are exempt from various requirements that apply to group health plans, including coverage and cost-sharing requirements. (Under current law, employers that sponsor group health plans that do not meet specified requirements are subject to an excise tax.) </p> <p>Coverage and payments under a qualified HRA are excluded from gross income, unless the employee does not have minimum essential coverage for the month in which the medical care was provided.</p> <p>Employers offering a qualified HRA must notify employees in advance regarding permitted benefits and report benefit information on W-2 forms and to health exchanges. </p> <p>The bill sets forth requirements for determining whether an employee covered under an HRA is also eligible for premium subsidies under PPACA. </p>]]></text>

Current law also allows, but does not require,&nbsp;the CMS to make such adjustments with respect to certain orthotics (such as splints and braces) and parenteral and enteral nutrients, equipment, and supplies (such as feeding tubes).&nbsp;The bill requires the CMS, in making&nbsp;these adjustments, to account for&nbsp;stakeholder input. In addition, the CMS must account for a comparison of competitive acquisition areas and other areas with respect to the following factors:</p> <ul> <li>average travel distance and cost associated with furnishing items and services, </li> <li>average volume of items and services furnished by suppliers, and </li> <li>number of suppliers.</li> </ul> <p>TITLE XVII--OTHER MEDICARE PROVISIONS</p> <p> (Sec. 17001) Until plan year 2019, the CMS may not terminate a Medicare Advantage (MA) plan solely because the plan failed to achieve a specified minimum quality rating.</p> <p>(Sec. 17002) The CMS&nbsp;must annually report on specified Medicare enrollment data.</p> <p>(Sec. 17003) The CMS&nbsp;shall: (1) request information and recommendations from stakeholders on information included in the&nbsp;Welcome to Medicare package, and (2)&nbsp;update the information included in the&nbsp;package accordingly.</p> <p> (Sec. 17004) Current law allows&nbsp;the CMS to impose a temporary moratorium on the enrollment of new providers under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) if necessary to combat fraud, waste, or abuse. With specified exceptions, the bill prohibits payment under these programs to new providers in areas subject to such temporary moratorium.</p> <p> (Sec. 17005) The bill expands and modifies enrollment and disenrollment options for MA-eligible individuals. Specifically, the bill extends the annual period in which an individual enrolled in MA may elect to instead receive benefits under the original Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) program as well as elect to change qualified prescription drug coverage. Furthermore, any MA-eligible individual (whether or not enrolled in MA) may once per period change a previous election with respect to receiving benefits through MA or Medicare FFS, including changing from one MA plan to another. Unsolicited marketing during this period is prohibited.</p> <p> (Sec. 17006) The bill allows individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) to be eligible for MA. Under current law, only individuals who develop ESRD while already enrolled in an MA plan may be considered eligible.</p> <p>With respect to payment, the bill: (1) shifts responsibility for the cost of kidney acquisitions from MA plans to Medicare's&nbsp;FFS program, and (2)&nbsp;excludes&nbsp;such costs&nbsp;from the calculation of certain benchmarks that&nbsp;form the basis for payment under MA plans.</p> <p>The CMS must conduct, and post online the results of, an evaluation of whether to include in a plan's quality rating a measure specifically related to care for MA enrollees with ESRD.</p> <p>The bill also modifies risk adjustment with respect to MA plans. Specifically, in making such adjustments, the CMS must:</p> <ul> <li>take into account&nbsp;an MA enrollee's total number of diseases or conditions, </li> <li>use at least two years of diagnostic data, </li> <li>provide separate adjustments for&nbsp;individuals dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, and </li> <li>evaluate whether other specified factors should be included in the risk adjustment model.</li> </ul> <p>(Sec. 17007) The bill establishes additional requirements for assigning Medicare&nbsp;FFS beneficiaries to accountable care organizations (ACOs) under the Medicare shared savings program. (The program enables ACOs to receive payments for savings stemming from care coordination and management.)</p> <p>Specifically, the bill requires the basis for assignment to reflect beneficiaries' utilization of not only primary care services provided by ACO physicians, but also those furnished in federally qualified health centers or rural health clinics.</p> <p>TITLE XVIII--OTHER PROVISIONS</p> <p> (Sec. 18001) This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), and other laws to exempt qualified small employer health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs) from certain requirements that apply to group health plans. </p> <p>A qualified small employer HRA is offered by employers that have fewer than 50 full-time employees and do not offer group health plans to any of their employees. A qualified small employer HRA must: </p> <ul> <li>be provided on the same terms to all eligible employees of the employer; </li> <li>be funded solely by the employer without salary reduction contributions; </li> <li>provide, after an employee provides proof of coverage, for the payment or reimbursement of medical expenses of the employee and family members; and </li> <li>limit annual payments and reimbursements to specified dollar amounts. </li> </ul> <p>HRAs that meet these requirements are not considered group health plans and are exempt from various requirements that apply to group health plans, including coverage and cost-sharing requirements. (Under current law, employers that sponsor group health plans that do not meet specified requirements are subject to an excise tax.) </p> <p>Coverage and payments under a qualified HRA are excluded from gross income, unless the employee does not have minimum essential coverage for the month in which the medical care was provided.</p> <p>Employers offering a qualified HRA must notify employees in advance regarding permitted benefits and report benefit information on W-2 forms and to health exchanges. </p> <p>The bill sets forth requirements for determining whether an employee covered under an HRA is also eligible for premium subsidies under PPACA. </p>]]></text>
