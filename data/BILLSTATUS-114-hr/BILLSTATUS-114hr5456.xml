The current 15-month limit for such services shall apply only when a child returns home from foster care.</p> <p>(Sec. 122) SSAct title IV part E is amended to require state plans for foster care and adoption assistance to require state procedures for the orderly and timely interstate placement of children to include by October 1, 2026, the use of an electronic interstate case-processing system.</p> <p>SSAct title IV part B (Child and Family Services) is amended to require the use of state grants for the development of an electronic interstate case-processing system to expedite the interstate placement of children in foster care or guardianship, or for adoption.</p> <p>HHS shall reserve certain FY2017 funds for such grants, to remain available through FY2021.</p> <p>(Sec. 123) The bill revises requirements for grants to regional partnerships delivering services and producing activities designed to implement IV-E prevention services, improve the well-being of, and improve permanency outcomes for, children and families affected by heroin, opioids and other substance abuse.</p> <p>A regional partnership shall include as mandatory partners the state agencies responsible for administering: </p> <ul> <li>the state plans for child and family services and for foster care and adoption assistance, and</li> <li>the substance abuse prevention and treatment block grant under the Public Health Service Act.</li> </ul> <p>A partnership proposing to serve children in out-of-home placements shall have as a mandatory partner the Juvenile Court or Administrative Office of the Court that is most appropriate to oversee the administration of court programs in the region to address the population of families who come to court attention because of child abuse or neglect.</p> <p>The bill reauthorizes such grants for FY2017-FY2021 in amounts between $250,000 (currently $500,000) and $1 million per grant per fiscal year.</p> <p>Such a grant shall be disbursed in two phases: (1) a planning phase (not to exceed two years); and (2) an implementation phase. The total disbursement to a grantee for the planning phase may not exceed $250,000, and may not exceed the total anticipated funding for the implementation phase.</p> <p>No payment shall be made for a fiscal year until HHS determines that the eligible partnership has made sufficient progress in meeting the goals of the grant, and that the members of the eligible partnership are coordinating to a reasonable degree with the other partnership members.</p> <p>Bill revises grant application requirements. </p> <p>HHS shall:</p> <ul> <li>review indicators that are used to assess periodically the performance of the grant recipients;

and</li> <li>a description of the steps the state is taking to improve caseworker training or the process, if any.</li> </ul> <p>(Sec. 132) State plans for child welfare services shall document steps taken to track and prevent child maltreatment deaths.</p> TITLE II--ENSURING THE NECESSITY OF A PLACEMENT THAT IS NOT IN A FOSTER FAMILY HOME <p>(Sec. 201) SSAct title IV part E is amended to prohibit federal payments to a state for amounts expended for foster care maintenance payments on behalf of a child unless:</p> <ul> <li>the child is placed in a child-care institution meeting certain criteria, or</li> <li>a child is placed in a qualified residential treatment meeting certain requirements.</li> </ul> <p>Settings for such placement, besides a qualified residential treatment program, include:</p> <ul> <li>one specializing in providing prenatal, post-partum, or parenting supports for youth; and</li> <li>a supervised independent living setting if the child is age 18 or over.</li> </ul> <p>To receive a grant to assess and improve the handling of proceedings relating to foster care and adoption, the highest state court shall provide for the training of judges, attorneys, and other legal personnel in child welfare cases on federal child welfare policies and payment limitations regarding children in foster care who are placed in settings that are not a foster family home.</p> <p>SSAct title IV part E is amended to require state plans for foster care and adoption assistance to certify that, in response to the limitation imposed by this bill on foster care maintenance payments on behalf of any child placed in a setting that is not a foster family home, the state will not enact or advance policies or practices that would result in a significant increase in the population of youth in the state's juvenile justice system.</p> <p>The Government Accountability Office (GAO) shall evaluate the impact, if any, on state juvenile justice systems of the limitation imposed by this bill on foster care maintenance payments on behalf of any child who is placed in a setting that is not a foster family home.</p> <p>(Sec. 202) For approval of the case plan and the case system review procedure for any child placed in a qualified residential treatment program, a trained professional or licensed clinician not employed by the state agency and not connected to, or affiliated with, any placement setting in which the state places children shall:</p> <ul> <li> assess the strengths and needs of the child using an age-appropriate, evidence-based, validated, HHS-approved functional assessment tool;</li> <li>determine whether the child's needs can be met with family members or through placement in a foster family home or, if not, which setting would give the most effective and appropriate level of care for the child in the least restrictive environment, consistent with the short- and long-term goals for the child specified in the child's permanency plan; and</li> <li>develop a list of child-specific short- and long-term mental and behavioral health goals.</li> </ul> <p>The state shall assemble for the child a family and permanency team consisting of all appropriate biological family members, relatives, and fictive kin of the child, as well as teachers, medical or mental health providers who have treated the child, or clergy who are a resource to the child's family.</p> <p>The bill prescribes procedures for deciding on a child's best placement.</p> <p>(Sec. 203) SSAct title IV part B is amended, regarding the Stephanie Tubbs Jones Child Welfare Services Program, to require each state plan for child welfare services to require any plan for the ongoing oversight and coordination of health care services for a child in a foster care placement to outline the procedures and protocols the state has established to ensure that children in foster care placements are not inappropriately diagnosed with emotional or behavioral disorders, medically fragile conditions, or developmental disabilities, and placed in settings that are not foster family homes as a result of such diagnoses.</p> <p>SSAct title IV part E is amended to direct HHS to evaluate these procedures and protocols.</p> <p>(Sec. 204) SSAct title IV part E is amended to require specified additional information among the state-by-state data in the annual report to Congress on the performance of each state regarding children in foster care who have been placed in a child care institution or other setting that is not a foster family home.</p> <p>TITLE III--CONTINUING SUPPORT FOR CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES</p> <p>(Sec. 301) SSA title IV part B is amended to make supporting and retaining foster families a family support service.</p> <p>The bill makes specified appropriations to HHS for FY2018 for competitive grants to states, Indian tribes, or tribal consortia to support the recruitment and retention of high-quality foster families to increase their capacity to place more children in family settings, focused on states, Indian tribes, or tribal consortia with the highest percentage of children in non-family settings.</p> <p>(Sec. 302) SSAct title IV part B is amended to reauthorize through FY2021:</p> <ul> <li>the Stephanie Tubbs Jones Child Welfare Services program,</li> <li>the Promoting Safe and Stable Families Program,</li> <li>funding for monthly caseworker visits and regional partnership grants, and</li> <li>funding for state courts to assess and improve handling of proceedings relating to foster care and adoption.</li> </ul> <p>(Sec. 303) SSAct title IV part E is amended to revise the John H.
