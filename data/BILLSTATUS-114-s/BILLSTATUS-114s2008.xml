          <text><![CDATA[<p><b>Transportation, Access, and Opportunity Act of 2015</b></p> <p> This bill modifies transportation programs to establish a goal of achieving an interconnected transportation system that connects people to jobs, schools, and essential services; and to require more data and public input during the planning process. </p> <p>States and metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) must permit the public to provide input during the development and implementation of transportation plans. </p> <p>(MPOs are federally required and funded organizations responsible for the regional transportation planning process in certain urban areas.) </p> <p>The bill revises the goals of the federal highway program to include achieving an interconnected transportation system which connects people to jobs, schools, and other essential services through a multimodal network. The Department of Transportation (DOT) may establish a performance measure for MPOs to measure transportation connectivity. </p> <p>DOT must establish the Connection to Opportunity Pilot Program for up to 10 MPOs to develop and implement projects to improve multimodal connectivity and increase connections for transportation-disadvantaged individuals and neighborhoods with limited transportation options. The participating MPOs must submit performance data to DOT, and DOT must use the data to evaluate the programs and consider developing a national indicator to measure multimodal connections to opportunities. </p> <p>DOT must create and maintain data sets and analysis tools to assist MPOs, states, and entities within DOT in carrying out performance management analyses. </p> <p>The bill permanently extends the authorization for the Transportation Alternatives Program, revises federal share requirements, and permits nonprofit organizations and certain MPOs to receive funding under the program. </p>]]></text>
