          <text><![CDATA[<p><b>Meat and Poultry Recall Notification Act of 2015 </b></p> <p>This bill amends the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, the Egg Products Inspection Act, and the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 to authorize the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to issue a mandatory recall of contaminated meat, poultry, and egg products. Under current law, recalls are voluntary actions taken by food companies. </p> <p>The bill modifies the definition of &quot;adulterated&quot; used for recalls to include a food product that bears or contains a pathogen or contaminant associated with serious illness or death. </p> <p>If USDA determines that food violates a food safety law and there is a reasonable probability that the food, if consumed, would present a threat to public health, USDA must: (1) notify consumers and public health officials, and (2) provide the company with an opportunity to take voluntary actions.</p> <p>If the company refuses to carry out voluntary actions within the time period and in the manner prescribed by USDA, USDA is authorized to control and possess the food, recall the food, and take other mandatory actions necessary to prevent its distribution. </p> <p>In the case of a recall, USDA must provide affected retailers with a notice containing the product information of each product subject to the recall, and the retailers must post the notice or notify consumers using a customer card system. </p> <p>The bill establishes procedures, including civil and criminal penalties, to enforce this bill and other food safety laws. </p>]]></text>
