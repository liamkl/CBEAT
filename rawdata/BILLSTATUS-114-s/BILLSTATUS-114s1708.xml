          <text><![CDATA[<p><b>Charter School Accountability Act of 2015</b></p> <p>This bill amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to replace the charter school grant program, through which states receive formula-based grants, with a competitive grant program.</p> <p>The Department of Education (ED) shall award grants to: (1) support the start up of charter schools that have been thoroughly vetted for quality and local impact, and (2) replicate or expand high-quality charter schools.</p> <p>To be eligible to receive grant funding, a state must:</p> <ul> <li>have legally binding rules related to fiduciary duties and conflicts of interest of charter school officers, directors, managers, and employees; </li> <li>require all charter schools to annually conduct and publicly disclose independent audits; </li> <li>provide that charter schools are covered by the state's open meetings and open records laws to the same extent as public schools are covered by those laws; </li> <li>have policies in effect that hold charter school authorizers accountable for monitoring a charter school's educational performance and financial operations; and </li> <li>require a charter school to make certain public disclosures related to its operation and funding. </li></ul> <p>The bill also revises the per-pupil facilities aid program, through which ED makes competitive matching grants to states to provide per-pupil financing to charter schools for facility acquisition, construction, and renovation. Specifically, a state may: (1) partner with one or more organizations to provide up to half of the state share of program funding, and (2) receive more than one program grant under specified circumstances.</p> <p>ED must conduct specified national activities, including awarding competitive grants directly to charter school developers in states that have not applied for or received charter school grants.</p>]]></text>
