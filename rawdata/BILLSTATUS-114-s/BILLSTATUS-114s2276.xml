          <text><![CDATA[<p><b>Securing America's Future Energy: Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act or the SAFE PIPES Act</b></p> <p>(Sec. 2) This bill reauthorizes through FY2019 the gas and hazardous liquid pipeline and related programs of the Department of Transportation (DOT), including emergency response grants, one-call notification programs, state damage prevention programs, community pipeline safety information grants, and the pipeline integrity program.</p> <p>(Sec. 3) DOT shall make periodic reports to Congress on the status of a final rule for required pipeline safety regulations for which no interim final rule or direct final rule has been issued, and any other significant pipeline safety rulemaking.</p> <p>(Sec. 4) The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) shall rescind a June 26, 2015, interpretative letter requiring placards on flammable hazardous materials (hazmat) carriers to be changed to represent the lowest flash point of the particular type of fuel transported during each shipment.</p> <p>The PHMSA shall reinstate previous regulations which provided that, as long as carriers do not transport a fuel with a lower flash point than the placard states, they shall not have to change the placard or purchase adjustable placards.</p> <p>(Sec. 5) The PHMSA shall prioritize the use of its resources for the completion of each such outstanding statutory requirement, including requirements for rulemakings and information collection requests, for a rulemaking before beginning any new rulemaking required after enactment of this bill unless DOT certifies to Congress a significant need to move forward with a new rulemaking.</p> <p>(Sec. 6) The Government Accountability Office (GAO) shall report on the natural gas integrity management and hazardous liquid integrity management programs.</p> <p>(Sec. 8) Two of the individuals selected for each Technical Pipeline Safety Standards Committee and each Technical Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Standards Committee must be state officials (currently, state commissioners). DOT must consult with national organizations representing commissioners (as under current law) or governors when making such a selection.</p> <p> (Sec. 9) After completion of any pipeline safety inspection, the PHMSA, or the state authority with a pipeline safety program certification, shall:</p> <ul> <li>conduct a post-inspection briefing with the operator outlining concerns, and to the extent practicable, present written preliminary findings; or </li> <li>issue the operator a final report, notice of amendment of plans or procedures, safety order, or corrective action order.</li> </ul> <p>(Sec. 10) The GAO shall assess:</p> <ul> <li> the feasibility of odorizing all combustible gas in transportation;</li> <li>the impacts of the odorization of all combustible gas in transportation on manufacturers, agriculture, and other end users; and </li> <li>the relative benefits and costs associated with odorizing all combustible gas in transportation compared to using other methods to mitigate pipeline leaks.</li> </ul> <p>(Sec. 11) DOT shall study improving existing damage prevention programs through technological improvements in location, mapping, and communications practices to prevent accidental excavation damage to a pipe or its coating, including considerations of technical, operational, and economic feasibility and existing damage prevention programs.</p> <p>(Sec. 12) The PHMSA shall review its staff resource management, including geographic allocation plans, hiring challenges, and expected retirement rates and strategies, and may certify at least annually the existence of any severe shortage of qualified candidates or a critical hiring need for a PHMSA position or group of positions.</p> <p>The PHMSA, after making such a certification, may hire a candidate for the position or candidates for the group of positions.</p> <p>(Sec. 13) In developing a research and development program plan for pipeline facility integrity, the PHMSA shall: (1) create opportunities for joint research ventures with non-federal entities to leverage limited federal research resources; and (2) permit collaborative research and development projects with appropriate non-federal organizations.</p> <p>(Sec. 14) DOT shall convene a working group to consider the development of a voluntary no-fault information sharing system to encourage collaborative efforts to improve inspection information feedback and information sharing regarding natural gas transmission and hazardous liquid pipeline integrity risk analysis.</p> <p>(Sec. 15) DOT shall:</p> <ul> <li>report on the feasibility of a national integrated pipeline safety regulatory inspection database to improve communication and collaboration between the PHMSA and state pipeline regulators;
