and </li> <li>the ISS should continue to provide a platform for fundamental, microgravity, discovery-based space life and physical sciences research. </li> </ul> <p>Congress reaffirms that it shall be U.S. policy, in consultation with its international partners in the ISS program, to support full and complete utilization of the ISS through at least 2024.</p> <p>(Sec. 302) The bill declares that it is U.S. policy that, in order to foster the competitive development, operation, improvement, and commercial availability of space transportation services, services for federal government access to and return from the ISS shall be procured by fair and open competition for well-defined, milestone-based, Federal Acquisition Regulation-based contracts. </p> <p>The Commercial Orbital Transportation Services Program is renamed as the Commercial Resupply Services Program. </p> <p>NASA shall protect the safety of U.S. space crews by ensuring that commercial crew systems meet all applicable human rating requirements under specified federal law.</p> <p>(Sec. 303) NASA shall develop a plan for transitioning the ISS from the current regime that relies heavily on NASA sponsorship to a regime where NASA is one of many customers of a low-Earth orbit commercial human space flight enterprise.</p> <p>NASA shall submit triennial reports until 2023 which include:</p> <ul> <li> identification of the low-Earth orbit capabilities necessary to meet its deep space human flight exploration objectives and mission requirements beyond the period of operation and use of the ISS;</li> <li>steps NASA is taking and will take, including demonstrations that could be conducted on the ISS, to stimulate and facilitate commercial demand and supply of products and services in low-Earth orbit;</li> <li>an assessment of current and projected commercial activities in low-Earth orbit, including on the ISS, and their potential for meeting the capabilities identified;</li> <li>identification of barriers preventing the commercialization of low-Earth orbit;</li> <li>evaluation of the feasible and preferred service life of the ISS beyond September 30, 2024, through at least 2028, as a unique scientific, commercial, and exploration-related facility;</li> <li>evaluation of the functions, roles, and responsibilities for the management and operation of the ISS; and</li> <li>a description of the progress on meeting human exploration research objectives on the ISS and prospects for accomplishing future exploration and other research objectives on future commercially supplied low-Earth orbit platforms or migration of those objectives to cis-lunar space. </li> </ul> <p>The bill defines &quot;cis-lunar space&quot; as the region of space from the Earth out to and including the region around the surface of the Moon. </p> <p>(Sec. 304) Any contract between NASA and a provider (a person that provides domestic launch or domestic reentry services to the federal government) may provide that the United States will indemnify that provider against successful claims (including reasonable expenses of litigation or settlement) by third parties for death, bodily injury, or loss of or damage to property resulting from launch services and reentry services carried out under the contract that are defined in it as unusually hazardous or nuclear in nature, but only to the extent the total amount of successful claims related to the activities under that contract:</p> <ul> <li>is more than the amount of insurance or demonstration of financial responsibility, and </li> <li>is not more than $1.5 billion (plus additional amounts necessary to reflect inflation occurring after January 1, 1989) above such insurance or financial responsibility amount. </li> </ul> <p>A contract made under this section that provides indemnification shall provide for:</p> <ul> <li>notice to the United States of any claim or suit against the provider for death, bodily injury, or loss of or damage to property; and </li> <li>control of or assistance in the defense by the United States, at its election, of such claim or suit and approval of any settlement. </li> </ul> <p>A provider that has a contract with NASA under this section shall obtain liability insurance or demonstrate financial responsibility in amounts to compensate for the maximum probable loss from claims by:</p> <ul> <li>a third party for death, bodily injury, or property damage or loss resulting from a launch service or reentry service carried out under the contract; and </li> <li>the federal government for damage or loss to government property resulting from a launch service or reentry service carried out under such contract. </li> </ul> <p>NASA shall determine maximum probable losses within 90 days of the provider requesting such a determination and submitting all of the information that NASA requires. NASA may revise such a determination if the revision is warranted based on new information.</p> <p>For the total claims related to one launch or reentry, a provider shall not be required to obtain insurance or demonstrate financial responsibility of more than:</p> <ul> <li>$500 million with respect to a third party, or $100 million with respect to the federal government; or </li> <li>the maximum liability insurance available on the world market at reasonable cost. </li> </ul> <p>An insurance policy or demonstration of financial responsibility regarding this section shall protect to the extent of their potential liability for involvement in launch services or reentry services:</p> <ul> <li>the federal government,</li> <li>federal government personnel,</li> <li>related entities of the federal government,</li> <li>related entities of the provider, and </li> <li>government astronauts (as defined in federal law).</li> </ul> <p>NASA may not indemnify a provider under this section until there is a cross-waiver between NASA and the provider.</p> <p>The bill states that NASA shall reciprocally waive claims with a provider under which each party agrees to be responsible for damage or loss to its property, or for losses resulting from any injury or death sustained by its employees or agents. Such a waiver shall apply only to the extent that the claims are more than the amount of insurance or demonstration of financial responsibility.</p> <p>Indemnification under this section may exclude claims that result from the willfull misconduct of the provider or its related entities.</p> <p>No payment may be made under this section unless NASA or its designee certifies that the amount is just and reasonable.</p>    <p>NASA may not provide indemnification under this section for an activity requiring a license or permit under provisions relating to commercial space launch activities.</p> <p>TITLE IV--ADVANCING HUMAN DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION</p> <p>Subtitle Human Exploration Goals and Objectives</p> <p>(Sec. 411) The bill states that the long-terms goals for the human space flight and exploration efforts of NASA shall be:</p> <ul> <li>to expand permanent human presence beyond low-Earth orbit with the involvement of international, academic, and industry partners;
