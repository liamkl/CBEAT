      <amendment>
        <purpose>An amendment printed in Part B of H.Res. 722 to authorize the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of State, to train and equip appropriately vetted elements of the Syrian opposition and other appropriately vetted Syrian groups or individuals. Additionally, the amendment strengthens congressional oversight by requiring detailed reports, including progress reports, on the plan, vetting process, and procedures for monitoring unauthorized end-use of provided training and equipment. It also requires the President to report on how this authority fits within a larger regional strategy. The amendment allows the Department of Defense (DOD) to submit a reprogramming request to Congress should the President request DOD funds to execute this authority and permit the Secretary of Defense to accept foreign contributions.</purpose>
