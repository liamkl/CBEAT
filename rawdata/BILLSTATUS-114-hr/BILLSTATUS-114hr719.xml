          <text><![CDATA[<p><b>Highlights:</b></p> <p>This bill provides continuing FY2016 appropriations to federal agencies until December 11, 2015, or the enactment of specified appropriations legislation. It is known as a continuing resolution (CR) and prevents a government shutdown that would otherwise occur when FY2016 begins on October 1, 2015, because none of the twelve FY2016 regular appropriations bills that fund the federal government have been enacted. </p> <p>The bill funds most projects and activities at the FY2015 levels, with the inclusion of an across-the-board reduction of less than 1% to most programs. The bill also includes a number of exceptions which provide funding flexibility and additional appropriations to various programs. </p> <p>The bill extends several programs and laws that are scheduled to expire at the end of FY2015, including the E-Verify program and the moratorium imposed by the Internet Tax Freedom Act. (Unless otherwise indicated, all extensions referenced in this summary are for the duration of the CR.) </p> <p>The bill also provides $700 million in emergency appropriations for Forest Service wildland fire suppression activities. Emergency funds are exempt from limits on discretionary spending. </p> <p>The bill requires the Transportation Security Administration to take a number of actions to ensure that Office of Inspection employees that are classified and paid as criminal investigators meet all of the legal and regulatory requirements for criminal investigator positions. </p> <p><b>Full Summary: </b></p> <p><b>TSA Office of Inspection Accountability Act of 2015 or the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2016 </b></p> <p>(Sec. 4) Requires the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General (OIG) to: (1) analyze the data and methods used by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to classify Office of Inspection (OOI) employees as criminal investigators; and (2) report relevant findings, including whether the data and methods are adequate and valid. </p> <p>Prohibits the TSA from hiring new OOI employees if the OIG finds that the data and methods are inadequate or invalid until: (1) the TSA certifies to Congress that only OOI employees who meet the minimum legal requirements are classified as criminal investigators and are receiving premium pay and other benefits associated with the classification, and (2) the OIG finds that the TSA's certification utilized adequate and valid data and methods. </p> <p>(Sec. 5) Requires the TSA to: (1) certify to Congress that only OOI employees who meet the minimum legal requirements are classified as criminal investigators and are receiving premium pay and other benefits associated with the classification, (2) reclassify OOI criminal investigator employees who do not, or are not expected to, spend an average of at least 50% of their time performing criminal investigative duties, and (3) report to Congress on the long-term cost savings from reclassified positions. </p> <p>(Sec. 6) Requires the TSA to report to Congress on the OOI's review of instances in which Federal Air Marshal Service officials obtained discounted or free firearms for personal use. </p> <p>(Sec. 7) Requires the OIG to submit to Congress a report: (1) reviewing the employee requirements, responsibilities, and benefits of criminal investigators in the OOI with criminal investigators employed at agencies adhering to the Office of Personnel Management employee classification system; and (2) identifying any inconsistencies and costs implications for differences between the varying employee requirements, responsibilities, and benefits. </p> <p>(Sec. 8) Requires the OIG to submit to Congress a study reviewing: (1) the Federal Air Marshal Service's existing personnel policies and procedures for identifying misuse of government resources; and (2) the administration of the Federal Air Marshal Service's existing code of conduct or integrity policies with respect to instances of misconduct. </p> <p>Provides continuing FY2016 appropriations to federal agencies until December 11, 2015, or enactment of specified appropriations legislation. </p> <p>(Sec. 101) Provides FY2016 appropriations to federal agencies for continuing projects or activities at the levels of, and under the terms and conditions of FY2015 appropriations Acts, reduced by 0.21% of both defense and non-defense discretionary programs. </p> <p>(Sec. 102) Prohibits funds provided by section 101 for the Department of Defense (DOD) from being used for: (1) new production of items not funded in FY2015 or prior years; (2) an increase in production rates above those sustained with FY2015 funds; or (3) the initiation, resumption, or continuation of any project, activity, operation, or organization for which funds or authority were not available during FY2015. </p> <p>Prohibits funds provided by section 101 to DOD from being used to initiate certain multi-year procurements. </p> <p>(Sec. 103) Specifies that funds provided by section 101 shall be available to the extent and in the manner that would be provided in the pertinent appropriations Act. </p> <p>(Sec. 104) Prohibits any appropriations or funds made available by section 101 from being used to initiate or resume any project or activity which was not funded in FY2015. </p> <p>(Sec. 105) Continues all authorities, requirements, and limitations from FY2015 appropriations Acts through the date in section 106 and permits valid obligations and expenditures during the period of this continuing resolution (CR). </p> <p>(Sec. 106) Continues the appropriations provided by this bill through the earlier of December 11, 2015, or the enactment of the pertinent appropriations Act. </p> <p>(Sec. 107) Requires expenditures for activities funded in this bill to be charged to the relevant account when the applicable appropriations bill becomes law. </p> <p>(Sec. 108) Waives the normal time limitations for submission and approval of apportionments of accounts funded in annual appropriations Acts. </p> <p>(Sec. 109) Limits disbursements for programs that otherwise would have high initial rates of operation or would complete distribution of funding at the beginning of the fiscal year if those actions would impinge on final congressional funding prerogatives. </p> <p>(Sec. 110) Directs that this bill be implemented so that only the most limited funding action permitted by this bill is taken in order to provide for continuation of projects and activities. </p> <p>(Sec. 111) Provides that entitlements and other mandatory payments with budget authority provided in FY2015 appropriations Acts and activities under the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 shall continue at the rate to maintain program levels under current law and under the authority and conditions provided in the applicable FY2015 appropriations Act for up to 30 days after the expiration of the CR. </p> <p>(Sec. 112) Provides that funding made available by this bill for civilian personnel compensation and benefits in each department and agency may be apportioned up to the rate of operations necessary to avoid furloughs.

          <text><![CDATA[<p>(This measure has not been amended since the Senate agreed to the House amendment with an amendment on September 30, 2015. The summary of that version is repeated here.)</p> <p><b>Highlights:</b></p> <p>This bill provides continuing FY2016 appropriations to federal agencies until December 11, 2015, or the enactment of specified appropriations legislation. It is known as a continuing resolution (CR) and prevents a government shutdown that would otherwise occur when FY2016 begins on October 1, 2015, because none of the twelve FY2016 regular appropriations bills that fund the federal government have been enacted. </p> <p>The bill funds most projects and activities at the FY2015 levels, with the inclusion of an across-the-board reduction of less than 1% to most programs. The bill also includes a number of exceptions which provide funding flexibility and additional appropriations to various programs. </p> <p>The bill extends several programs and laws that are scheduled to expire at the end of FY2015, including the E-Verify program and the moratorium imposed by the Internet Tax Freedom Act. (Unless otherwise indicated, all extensions referenced in this summary are for the duration of the CR.) </p> <p>The bill also provides $700 million in emergency appropriations for Forest Service wildland fire suppression activities. Emergency funds are exempt from limits on discretionary spending. </p> <p>The bill requires the Transportation Security Administration to take a number of actions to ensure that Office of Inspection employees that are classified and paid as criminal investigators meet all of the legal and regulatory requirements for criminal investigator positions. </p> <p><b>Full Summary: </b></p> <p><b>TSA Office of Inspection Accountability Act of 2015 or the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2016 </b></p> <p>(Sec. 4) Requires the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General (OIG) to: (1) analyze the data and methods used by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to classify Office of Inspection (OOI) employees as criminal investigators; and (2) report relevant findings, including whether the data and methods are adequate and valid. </p> <p>Prohibits the TSA from hiring new OOI employees if the OIG finds that the data and methods are inadequate or invalid until: (1) the TSA certifies to Congress that only OOI employees who meet the minimum legal requirements are classified as criminal investigators and are receiving premium pay and other benefits associated with the classification, and (2) the OIG finds that the TSA's certification utilized adequate and valid data and methods. </p> <p>(Sec. 5) Requires the TSA to: (1) certify to Congress that only OOI employees who meet the minimum legal requirements are classified as criminal investigators and are receiving premium pay and other benefits associated with the classification, (2) reclassify OOI criminal investigator employees who do not, or are not expected to, spend an average of at least 50% of their time performing criminal investigative duties, and (3) report to Congress on the long-term cost savings from reclassified positions. </p> <p>(Sec. 6) Requires the TSA to report to Congress on the OOI's review of instances in which Federal Air Marshal Service officials obtained discounted or free firearms for personal use. </p> <p>(Sec. 7) Requires the OIG to submit to Congress a report: (1) reviewing the employee requirements, responsibilities, and benefits of criminal investigators in the OOI with criminal investigators employed at agencies adhering to the Office of Personnel Management employee classification system; and (2) identifying any inconsistencies and costs implications for differences between the varying employee requirements, responsibilities, and benefits. </p> <p>(Sec. 8) Requires the OIG to submit to Congress a study reviewing: (1) the Federal Air Marshal Service's existing personnel policies and procedures for identifying misuse of government resources; and (2) the administration of the Federal Air Marshal Service's existing code of conduct or integrity policies with respect to instances of misconduct. </p> <p>Provides continuing FY2016 appropriations to federal agencies until December 11, 2015, or enactment of specified appropriations legislation. </p> <p>(Sec. 101) Provides FY2016 appropriations to federal agencies for continuing projects or activities at the levels of, and under the terms and conditions of FY2015 appropriations Acts, reduced by 0.21% of both defense and non-defense discretionary programs. </p> <p>(Sec. 102) Prohibits funds provided by section 101 for the Department of Defense (DOD) from being used for: (1) new production of items not funded in FY2015 or prior years; (2) an increase in production rates above those sustained with FY2015 funds; or (3) the initiation, resumption, or continuation of any project, activity, operation, or organization for which funds or authority were not available during FY2015. </p> <p>Prohibits funds provided by section 101 to DOD from being used to initiate certain multi-year procurements. </p> <p>(Sec. 103) Specifies that funds provided by section 101 shall be available to the extent and in the manner that would be provided in the pertinent appropriations Act. </p> <p>(Sec. 104) Prohibits any appropriations or funds made available by section 101 from being used to initiate or resume any project or activity which was not funded in FY2015. </p> <p>(Sec. 105) Continues all authorities, requirements, and limitations from FY2015 appropriations Acts through the date in section 106 and permits valid obligations and expenditures during the period of this continuing resolution (CR). </p> <p>(Sec. 106) Continues the appropriations provided by this bill through the earlier of December 11, 2015, or the enactment of the pertinent appropriations Act. </p> <p>(Sec. 107) Requires expenditures for activities funded in this bill to be charged to the relevant account when the applicable appropriations bill becomes law. </p> <p>(Sec. 108) Waives the normal time limitations for submission and approval of apportionments of accounts funded in annual appropriations Acts. </p> <p>(Sec. 109) Limits disbursements for programs that otherwise would have high initial rates of operation or would complete distribution of funding at the beginning of the fiscal year if those actions would impinge on final congressional funding prerogatives. </p> <p>(Sec. 110) Directs that this bill be implemented so that only the most limited funding action permitted by this bill is taken in order to provide for continuation of projects and activities. </p> <p>(Sec. 111) Provides that entitlements and other mandatory payments with budget authority provided in FY2015 appropriations Acts and activities under the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 shall continue at the rate to maintain program levels under current law and under the authority and conditions provided in the applicable FY2015 appropriations Act for up to 30 days after the expiration of the CR. </p> <p>(Sec. 112) Provides that funding made available by this bill for civilian personnel compensation and benefits in each department and agency may be apportioned up to the rate of operations necessary to avoid furloughs. Requires all necessary actions to reduce or defer non-personnel-related administrative expenses to be taken prior to using this authority.</p> <p> (Sec. 113) Permits funds appropriated by this bill to be obligated and expended notwithstanding specified statutory provisions restricting appropriations for foreign assistance, the Department of State, international broadcasting, and intelligence activities in the absence of prior authorizations. </p> <p>(Sec. 114) Extends designations for Overseas Contingency Operations/ Global War on Terrorism and disaster relief to funds provided by this bill that previously carried those designations. </p> <p>Exempts funds designated or otherwise provided as Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism, the Social Security Administration's continuing disability reviews and redeterminations, health care fraud and abuse control, disaster relief, and emergency requirements from the across-the-board reduction included in section 101. </p> <p>Provides that amounts designated for Overseas Contingency Operations/ Global War on Terrorism shall only be available if the President subsequently designates the amounts and transmits the designations to Congress. </p> <p>(Sec. 115) Applies the across-the-board reduction in section 101 to advance appropriations made in prior years that first become available in FY2016. </p> <p>(Sec. 116) Provides a higher rate of funding for the Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) Commodity Assistance Program, including the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, which is a domestic food assistance program that predominantly serves low-income elderly individuals. </p> <p>(Sec. 117) Provides USDA with funding flexibility to pay ongoing debt service for multi-family direct loan program rental assistance contracts under sections 514 and 515 of the Housing Act of 1949.
