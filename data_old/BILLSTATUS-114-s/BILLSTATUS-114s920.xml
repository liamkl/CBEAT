Requires a reduction in the amount of such credit by any tax deduction or other credit allowed for qualified relicensing costs. Makes this tax credit effective for taxable years beginning after 2014. </p> <p>(Sec. 3) Increases from 30% to 40% the rate of the continuous levy on payments to Medicare providers and suppliers for unpaid taxes, effective for payments made after 180 days after the enactment of this Act. </p>]]></text>
