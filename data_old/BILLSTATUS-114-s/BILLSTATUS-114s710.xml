Currently appropriations are authorized only through FY2013.</p> <p> (Sec. 504) Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 to authorize the Secretary to guarantee Indian housing loans through FY2020. Authorizes appropriations for such guarantees. </p> <p>TITLE VI--DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM FOR ALTERNATIVE PRIVATIZATION AUTHORITY FOR NATIVE AMERICAN HOUSING</p> <p> (Sec. 601) Amends NAHASDA to establish a demonstration program that requires a participating Indian tribe to select a private investor partner and, with that partner, to develop and implement a HUD-approved plan to address the tribe's housing needs. Requires each participating tribe to obtain assistance from a qualified entity in assessing its housing needs.</p> <p>Bars the Secretary from approving more than 20 tribes for participation in the demonstration program. </p> <p>Makes the block grant amounts that would otherwise have been allocated to a participating tribe under NAHASDA available under the demonstration program to: (1) provide investor partners or other investors with a full return on their investment in the tribe's housing needs, (2) cover a tribe's administrative costs, and (3) cover housing infrastructure costs associated with providing affordable housing for the tribe. </p> <p>Permits a participating tribe, in accordance with the tribe's final plan, to resell any affordable housing developed with assistance under NAHASDA for use other than as affordable housing, but only if the tribe makes certain assurances with respect to meeting the needs for affordable housing. </p> <p>TITLE VII--MISCELLANEOUS</p> <p>(Sec. 701) Declares that a tribally designated housing entity shall qualify as a community-based development organization for purposes of the Indian Community Development Block Grant program authorized under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. </p> <p>(Sec. 702) Amends the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Reauthorization Act of 2008 to repeal the limitation on the use of funds under that Act for the benefit of the Cherokee Nation. </p> <p> (Sec. 703) Amends NAHASDA to reauthorize the block grant program for affordable housing for Native Hawaiians through FY2020. </p> <p> (Sec. 704) Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 to authorize HUD to guarantee Native Hawaiian housing loans through FY2020.
