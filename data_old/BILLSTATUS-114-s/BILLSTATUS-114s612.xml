          <text><![CDATA[<b><p /><strong>Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act or the WIIN Act</strong></b> <p>TITLE I--WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT</p> <em>Water Resources Development Act of 2016</em> <p>Subtitle A--General Provisions</p> <p>(Sec. 1101) This bill requires the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to enter cooperative agreements with youth service and conservation corps organizations for services on Corps projects.</p> <p>(Sec. 1102) The Corps of Engineers must use its existing channel depths and dimensions authority under the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1915 to carry out navigation safety activities at harbor or inland harbor projects eligible for Corps operation and maintenance under the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (WRDA 1986), including at entrances, bends, sidings, and turning places necessary for the free movement of boats.</p> <p>(Sec. 1103) The bill makes permanent a requirement under WRDA 1986 that the Corps of Engineers use at least 10% (currently, exactly 10%) of the difference between the funds made available for a fiscal year to pay operations and maintenance costs of harbors and inland harbors and the funds that were available for such costs for FY2012 as priority funding for emerging harbor projects that transit less than 1 million tons of cargo annually.</p> <p>(Sec. 1104) The Corps of Engineers must report on its inventory and assessment of the structural condition of all federal breakwaters and jetties protecting harbors and inland harbors. </p> <p>(Sec. 1105) The Water Resources Development Act of 2007 (WRDA 2007) is amended to require the Corps of Engineers to consider regional (currently, local) communities when it makes recommendations for harbor and navigation improvements that are not justified solely by national economic development benefits.</p> <p>(Sec. 1106) The Corps of Engineers may enter agreements to assume the operation and maintenance costs of an alternative project to maintenance dredging for a federal navigation channel if the costs of the operation and maintenance of the alternative project, and any remaining costs necessary for maintaining the federal navigation channel, are less than the costs of maintaining such channel without the alternative project. </p> <p>(Sec. 1107) The bill makes permanent the Corps of Engineers' authority to use available priority funds (the difference between funds made available for operations and maintenance costs assigned to commercial navigation of harbors under WRDA 1986 each fiscal year and those funds made available for FY2012) for underserved harbors and projects within the Great Lakes Navigation System. </p> <p>(Sec. 1108) If the target total budget resources available to the Corps of Engineers from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) for a fiscal year is lower than the resources for the previous fiscal year, the target shall be adjusted to be the lesser of: (1) 103% of the total appropriated for the previous fiscal year, or (2) 100% of the harbor maintenance taxes received in the previous fiscal year.</p> <p>(Sec. 1109) The Corps of Engineers may maintain federally authorized harbors of refuge to restore and maintain authorized dimensions.</p> <p>(Sec. 1110) The bill amends the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (WRRDA 2014) to revise the payment allocations to donor ports and energy transfer ports through the establishment of a new category of medium-sized donor ports that are eligible for funding if they annually collect between $5 million and $15 million of total HMTF funding (donor ports must currently collect at least $15 million annually to be eligible). </p> <p>The bill modifies the method of transferring through the U.S. Customs and Border Protection payments that ports may currently elect to provide to importers or shippers. The new process: (1) excludes shippers from being eligible recipients of such payments, and (2) requires payment calculations by the Corps of Engineers based on discretionary cargo (maritime cargo for which the U.S. port of unlading is different than the U.S. port of entry) that is shipped through the ports and that is most at risk of diversion to seaports outside the United States. The Corps of Engineers must determine the top importers at a port electing to provide such payments, as ranked by value of discretionary cargo, and payments shall be limited to those top importers. </p> <p>The bill extends through FY2020, or through FY2025 if target total budget resources are met, the authorization for funding to such donor ports, medium-sized donor ports, and energy transfer ports for: (1) payments to importers, (2) maintenance dredging that benefits commercial navigation at harbors, or (3) environmental remediation related to dredging berths and federal navigation channels. </p> <p>(Sec. 1111) The bill extends to contracts for physical construction that have not been awarded before enactment of WRRDA 2014 the formula that calculates the harbor deepening costs to be paid by nonfederal interests during construction for harbor or inland harbor navigation projects. For the portion of a project that has a depth in excess of 45 feet but not in excess of 50 feet, the cost to be paid by nonfederal interests is decreased from 50% to 25% of the cost of construction for that portion.</p> <p>(Sec. 1112) The Corps of Engineers must publish guidance for the implementation of WRRDA 2014 provisions concerning maintenance of emerging ports and Great Lakes ports.</p> <p>(Sec. 1113) The Corps of Engineers may permit a nonfederal interest to carry out maintenance activities necessary to ensure that a navigation project is maintained to not less than the minimum project dimensions. Costs incurred by the nonfederal interest are eligible for reimbursement up to the estimated federal cost, but are limited to costs directly related to the performance of work for the federal government and the actual fiscal year appropriations for that portion of maintenance dredging. Any reimbursement is subject to the nonfederal interest complying with all federal laws and regulations that would apply if such maintenance activities were carried out by the Corps. </p> <p>In carrying out the maintenance activities, the nonfederal interest shall: (1) provide equipment at no cost to the federal government, and (2) hold the United States free from damages that arise from the use of the equipment. This section terminates 10 years after enactment of this bill. </p> <p>(Sec. 1114) The Corps of Engineers' next biennial HMTF report on operations and maintenance costs assigned to commercial navigation of harbors and inland harbors must identify transportation cost savings realized by achieving and maintaining the constructed width and depth for such harbors on a project-by-project basis. This requirement does not apply to subsequent reports.</p> <p>(Sec. 1115) The Corps of Engineers must establish a pilot program to accept services from nonfederal interests or commercial entities for removal of sediment captured behind up to 10 U.S. dams under Corps jurisdiction for the purpose of restoring authorized storage capacity. The nonfederal interests or commercial entities may sell or otherwise dispose of the removed sediment without compensating the Corps for the sediment's value.</p> <p>(Sec. 1116) In a state in which a drought emergency has been declared or was in effect during the year before enactment of this bill, the Corps of Engineers may enter agreements with nonfederal interests to carry out approved water supply conservation measures.</p> <p>(Sec. 1117) Upon the request of a governor of a state with a drought emergency during the year leading up to the enactment of this bill, the Corps of Engineers may prioritize updates of water control manuals and incorporate seasonal operations for water conservation and water supply for control structures.</p> <p>(Sec. 1118) The Corps of Engineers, at a nonfederal interest's request, may review proposals to increase the quantity of available water supplies at federal water resources development projects through: (1) modification of the project, (2) modification of how a project is managed, or (3) access to water released from a project. But this section shall not apply to proposals that: (1) reallocate existing water supply or hydropower storage, or (2) reduce water available for any authorized project purpose.</p> <p>If a proposal relates to a federal project that is not operated by the Corps of Engineers, this section applies only to activities under the Corps' authority.</p> <p>The Corps of Engineers must comply with public participation requirements and provide a copy of proposals to federal agencies that operate a project, affected states, power marketing administrations, and other entities with project rights or responsibilities.</p> <p>The Corps of Engineers shall not approve a proposal that: (1) is not supported by the federal agency that operates the project, (2) adversely impacts contractual or legal rights, (3) increases costs to other entities, (4) interferes with authorized project purposes, or (5) modifies federal statutory requirements without congressional authorization.</p> <p>The cost of developing, reviewing, and implementing a submitted proposal shall be provided by a nonfederal entity. But if an entity working with a state is authorized to receive the Corps of Engineers' assistance in the preparation of a comprehensive plan, the Corps may use those funds to pay 50% of the cost of the entity's proposal review. </p> <p>Special requirements are set forth for operation and maintenance costs relating to the construction of additional water supply storage at a reservoir for use under a water supply storage agreement. </p> <p>Other entities may contribute to the costs of implementing a proposal. </p> <p>The Corps of Engineers may provide technical assistance for a proposal if the nonfederal interest agrees to pay the costs of the assistance. </p> <p>This section shall not apply to reservoirs in the Upper Missouri River, the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint river system, the Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa river system, or the Stones River.</p> <p>(Sec. 1119) For federally recognized Indian tribes, local cost-sharing requirements for studies and projects are waived up to a specified amount.</p> <p>(Sec. 1120) The Corps of Engineers must submit to Congress: (1) the Tribal Consultation Policy reports that it currently submits to the Office of Management and Budget; and (2) a report on its review of existing policies, regulations, and guidance related to consultation with Indian tribes that may have an impact on tribal cultural or natural resources. </p> <p>(Sec. 1121) The Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (WRDA 2000) is amended to allow the Corps of Engineers to carry out cost-shared design and construction of water resources development projects under the tribal partnership program.</p> <p>At an Indian tribe's request, the Corps of Engineers must report on the feasibility of a water resources development project that will substantially benefit Indian tribes. </p> <p>The Corps of Engineers may carry out the design and construction of a feasible tribal partnership project if: (1) the federal share is not more than $10 million, or (2) congressional authorization is obtained for a federal share exceeding $10 million.</p> <p>The Corps of Engineers is prohibited from requiring an Indian tribe to waive its sovereign immunity as a condition to entering into a cost-sharing agreement under the tribal partnership program.</p> <p>The bill sets forth the nonfederal cost shares for studies, design and construction, and watershed and river basin assessments under the expanded program.</p> <p>(Sec. 1122) The Corps of Engineers must establish a pilot program to carry out 10 cost-sharing projects for the beneficial use of dredged material. Project selections must be based solely on: (1) environmental, economic, and social benefits; and (2) diversity in project types and geographical locations. The projects are exempt from federal standards that require dredged material disposals representing the least costly alternatives. Regional teams that include local agencies and stakeholders must be established to identify and assist in implementation of projects.</p> <p>The Corps of Engineers may use sediment from other federal and nonfederal sources, but any nonfederal source sediment must be obtained without federal expense. Federal water resources projects involving the disposal of dredged material may include a single or periodic application of sediment for beneficial use and shall not require operation and maintenance. The Corps may accept funds from a nonfederal interest to dispose of such dredged material for private shores or lands that are ineligible for federal cost sharing.</p> <p>(Sec. 1123) The bill repeals provisions of WRDA 2000 concerning the authorization of appropriations for Great Lakes fishery and ecosystem restoration plans and projects. </p> <p>(Sec. 1124) A Corps of Engineers coordinator and principal approving official must be designated to acquire Federal Aviation Administration authorizations for the Corps to operate small unmanned aircraft systems (drones) to support civil works and emergency response missions.</p> <p>(Sec. 1125) The Corps of Engineers may accept funds from a railroad carrier to expedite the evaluation of the carrier's permits for a project under the Corps' jurisdiction. (Currently, the Corps may accept such funds from only public utility or natural gas companies to expedite such a permit.) The Corps' authority to accept such contributions for expedited permit processing is extended through June 10, 2024.</p> <p>(Sec. 1126) The Corps of Engineers may provide technical assistance to nonfederal interests for feasibility studies of a proposed water resources development project if the nonfederal interest contracts to pay the costs of such assistance. </p> <p>(Sec. 1127) The Corps of Engineers may authorize credits or reimbursements for discrete segments of a flood reduction project under WRDA 1986 before final completion of the project if the nonfederal interest can independently operate and maintain the segment without creating a hazard in advance of project completion.</p> <p>(Sec. 1128) The Corps of Engineers may cooperate with groups of states to prepare comprehensive plans for the development, utilization, and conservation of the water and related resources of drainage basins, watersheds, or ecosystems located within their boundaries. States may combine funds that the Corps makes available to them for such purposes.</p> <p>(Sec. 1129) The cost-share assistance under the Water Resources Development Act of 1974 that is provided to Indian tribes, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Marianas, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands to prepare comprehensive plans for the development, utilization, and conservation of the water and related resources of drainage basins, watersheds, or ecosystems shall be as provided under the local cost-sharing waivers for U.S. territories under WRDA 1986.</p> <p>(Sec. 1130) State regional districts' flood damage reduction projects are eligible for assistance from: (1) the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to establish a levee safety program, and (2) the Corps of Engineers for flood mitigation activities. The national levee database, inventory and review procedures, and safety guidelines must be updated to include regional district participation.</p> <p>(Sec. 1131) The categories of "nonfederal interests" under the Flood Control Act of 1970 are expanded to include Alaska native villages, regional corporations, and village corporations among the entities that may enter partnership agreements with the Corps for implementation or construction of water resources projects.</p> <p>(Sec. 1132) The Corps of Engineers' post-authorization change reports recommending modifications to authorized projects: (1) may not be delayed by policy or priority change considerations, and (2) must be submitted to Congress upon completion.</p> <p>(Sec. 1133) The Corps of Engineers must establish a publicly available database on its dredging projects, including information on maintenance dredging carried out by federal and nonfederal vessels. For each project and contract, the database must include estimated and actual data on the number of private contractor bids received and the bid amounts.</p> <p>(Sec. 1134) The Corps of Engineers' system for electronic submission of permit applications must: (1) allow applicants to prepare permit applications, request jurisdictional determinations, and track their status electronically; and (2) address joint applications for state and federal permits. The Corps must maintain records of each permit decision and jurisdictional determination for at least five years and then archive those records. </p> <p>(Sec. 1135) The Corps of Engineers must publish data on: (1) the planning, design, construction, operation, and maintenance of water resources development projects; and (2) water quality and water management of projects owned, operated, or managed by the Corps. But disclosure is not authorized for confidential or privileged information, law enforcement or national security information, infrastructure security information, or personal information.</p> <p>(Sec. 1136) Transmittal letters and attachments printed as House or Senate documents for certain proposed reports and recommendations transmitted to Congress for flood control or navigation improvements must be made publicly available. </p> <p>The Corps of Engineers must provide the Library of Congress a copy of each final post-authorization change report for water resources projects. </p> <p>(Sec. 1137) The Corps of Engineers must report on the amount of acquisitions it has made in the prior fiscal year for civil works projects from entities that manufactured the articles, materials, or supplies outside of the United States. The report must indicate dollar values and summarize total procurement funds spent on goods manufactured inside versus outside the United States for each category of acquisition. </p> <p>(Sec. 1138) The Corps of Engineers' international outreach program is expanded to include informing the United States of technological innovations abroad that could improve any water resources development in the United States, including technology transfers or exchanges. (Under current law, the program is limited to informing the maritime industry and port authorities about innovations that could improve waterborne transportation.) </p> <p>(Sec. 1139) The Corps of Engineers must issue guidance for dam safety repair projects to: (1) identify the types of circumstances under which WRDA 1986's requirement relating to state-of-the-art design or construction criteria deemed necessary for safety purposes would apply, (2) assist Corps district offices in communicating with nonfederal interests when entering into and implementing cost-sharing agreements, and (3) assist Corps communications with nonfederal interests concerning their estimated and final cost-share responsibilities.</p> <p>(Sec. 1140) The Corps of Engineers' projects to support the fishery, ecosystem, and beneficial uses of the Great Lakes may include compatible recreation features, except that the federal cost of such features may not exceed 10% of the ecosystem restoration costs of the project.</p> <p>(Sec. 1141) WRDA 2007 is amended to extend the period during which the Corps of Engineers is prohibited from taking action seeking to remove an improvement (including dwellings) within the flowage easement of Lake Kemp, Texas (below elevation 1159 feet mean sea level), until the earlier of: (1) January 1, 2025, or (2) the transfer of ownership of an improvement occurring after this bill's enactment. </p> <p>(Sec. 1142) The Corps of Engineers must report on corrosion prevention actions and projects.</p> <p>(Sec. 1143) The Corps of Engineers is authorized to conduct a study of the economic and noneconomic costs, benefits, and impacts of acquiring sediment from domestic and nondomestic sources for shoreline protection. The Corps must report on the results of the study. </p> <p>(Sec. 1144) The Corps of Engineers must give priority to flood management projects that have executed project partnership agreements in areas where: (1) there has been loss of life due to flood events and the President has declared a major disaster or an emergency under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, or (2) there is a significant risk for catastrophic flooding.</p> <p>(Sec. 1145) The Corps of Engineers must coordinate with Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas to assess the recovery of Gulf Coast oyster beds damaged by: (1) Hurricane Katrina in 2005, (2) the <em>Deepwater Horizon</em> oil spill in 2010, and (3) floods in 2011 and 2016. </p> <p>(Sec. 1146) For initiation of work on a separable element of a water resources development project that has received construction funds in the previous six years: (1) no new start or new investment decision is required, and (2) the work shall be treated as ongoing work.</p> <p>(Sec. 1147) The Corps of Engineers must expedite environmental decisions and reviews related to the construction of, impoundment of water in, and operation of, the Lower Bois d'Arc Creek Reservoir Project, including any associated water transmission facilities, by the North Texas Municipal Water District in Fannin County, Texas. </p> <p>(Sec. 1148) The bill revises WRRDA 2014's standards for floating cabins with overnight accommodations on Corps of Engineers' waters in the Cumberland River basin. The amended standards may not be construed to authorize the Corps to impose requirements on floating cabins or facilities (including marinas or docks located on such waters) that are different or more stringent than the requirements imposed on all recreational vessels authorized to use such waters.</p> <p>(Sec. 1149) At the request of state or local officials, the Corps of Engineers must identify and allow implementation of appropriate safety measures addressing navigation hazards in federally marked or maintained Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway navigation channels adjacent to a marina. In identifying appropriate measures, the Corps must consider whether: (1) documented safety hazards are a direct result of excessive wakes from recreational vessels, (2) proposed measures will remedy safety concerns without significant impacts to the navigable capacity of the channel, and (3) the measures are consistent with any Coast Guard recommendations to ensure the safety of vessels and passengers. </p> <p>(Sec. 1150) The Corps of Engineers may carry out small flood control projects under the Flood Control Act of 1948 that are not specifically authorized by Congress, including planning, design, construction, and monitoring of structural and nonstructural technologies to prevent and mitigate flood damages associated with ice jams. During FY2017-FY2022, the Corps must carry out at least 10 projects to demonstrate such technologies and designs. Projects must be selected from all cold U.S. regions, including the Upper Missouri River Basin and the Northeast region.</p> <p>(Sec. 1151) The Corps of Engineers must develop a structural health monitoring program to assess and improve the condition of Corps infrastructure, including systems and frameworks for: (1) response to floods and earthquakes, (2) predisaster mitigation measures, (3) lengthening the useful life of the infrastructure, and (4) identifying risks due to sea level rise.</p> <p>(Sec. 1152) The Corps of Engineers must transfer the human remains known as Kennewick Man or the Ancient One to the Washington State Department of Archaeology and Historic Preservation to dispose of and repatriate the remains through the State Historic Preservation Officer to the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, the Nez Perce Tribe, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, and the Wanapum Band of Priest Rapids. The transfer is conditioned on the tribes: (1) following the state of Washington's requirements under state laws; and (2) verifying their agreement on a final burial place in, and legal custody of the remains by, the state of Washington. </p> <p>(Sec. 1153) The bill amends WRRDA 2014 to allow the Corps of Engineers to accept materials, services, or funds from a nonfederal public entity, a nonprofit entity, or a private entity to repair, restore, replace, or maintain a water resources project if there is a risk of adverse impacts to the functioning of the project. (Under current law, the Corps may accept only materials or services for repairing, restoring, or replacing such a project that has been damaged or destroyed as a result of an emergency.)</p> <p>The Corps may: (1) use such accepted materials and services only if they comply with all applicable laws and regulations that would apply if they were acquired by the Corps, and (2) accept services only to provide supplementary services to existing federal employees and to perform work that would not otherwise be accomplished as a result of funding or personnel limitations. </p> <p>(Sec. 1154) The Corps of Engineers' funding of response actions to address human health and environmental threats from military munitions deposited on a beach shall be reimbursed from amounts made available to the Department of Defense (DOD) agency responsible for the original release of the munitions.</p> <p>(Sec. 1155) The Water Resources Development Act of 1992 (WRDA 1992) is amended to authorize the Corps of Engineers to allow a nonfederal public entity that has entered into a cooperative agreement for the operation and management of recreation facilities and natural resources at civil works projects under the Corps' jurisdiction to collect user fees for the use of developed recreation sites and facilities, whether developed or constructed by such entity or the Corps. </p> <p>These nonfederal public entities may: (1) use any visitor reservation service that the Corps of Engineers has provided for by contract or interagency agreement to manage fee collections and reservations, subject to the Corps' terms and conditions; and (2) retain the fees collected to pay for operation, maintenance, and management at the recreation site where they were collected.</p> <p>(Sec. 1156) If a person or entity seeks permission from the Corps of Engineers for an occupation, use, or alteration of a harbor or river public works project that also requires review under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) or another legal authority, the reviews and approvals shall occur concurrently to the extent practicable.
