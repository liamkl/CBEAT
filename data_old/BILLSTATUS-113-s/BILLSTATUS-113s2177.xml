Requires the Director to establish standards for the certification of personnel and determine whether a laboratory or entity is eligible for federal funds. Directs the Director of the National Institute of Justice to develop a plan for assisting and supporting forensic science laboratories and covered entities in obtaining accreditation and certifications for relevant personnel.</p> <p>Requires the Board to recommend and the Director to establish: (1) a comprehensive strategy for fostering and improving peer-reviewed scientific research relating to the forensic science disciplines, and (2) a list of priorities for forensic science research funding. Directs: (1) the Board to submit to the Director a plan for encouraging collaboration among universities, nonprofit research institutions, state and local forensic science laboratories, private forensic science laboratories, private corporations, and the federal government to develop and perform cost-effective and reliable research in the forensic sciences; and (2) the Director to establish and disseminate uniform standards and best practices for the forensic science disciplines.</p> <p>Authorizes the Director of NIST to make grants to eligible entities to conduct peer-reviewed scientific research in areas consistent with the Director's research priorities.</p> <p>Requires the Board to submit and the Director to implement plans: (1) for supporting, and a standardized curriculum for, the education and training of judges, attorneys, and law enforcement personnel in the forensic sciences and fundamental scientific principles; (2) for supporting the development of undergraduate and graduate educational programs in the forensic science disciplines and related fields; and (3) for encouraging governments to implement systems to ensure that qualified individuals perform medical-legal death examinations and for encouraging qualified individuals to enter the field.</p> <p>Directs the Board and the Director to regularly coordinate with: (1) relevant federal agencies to make efficient and appropriate use of research expertise and funding; (2) the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and other relevant federal agencies to determine ways in which the forensic science disciplines may assist in homeland security and emergency preparedness; and (3) the intelligence community to make use of research and new technologies suitable for forensic science.</p> <p>Requires the Director to develop a system for any individual to anonymously provide information regarding lack of compliance with standards established by this Act.</p> <p>Requires the Board to submit and the Director to implement: (1) a plan to require interoperability among databases and technologies in each of the forensic science disciplines among all levels of government, in all states, and with the private sector; and (2) a recommended code of ethics for the forensic science disciplines.</p> <p>Requires the Director to: (1) conduct a needs assessment of state and local forensic service providers to evaluate their capacity and resource needs, (2) develop a national strategy for developing the capacity and resources of state and local forensic science providers, and (3) update such assessment and strategy at least once every five years. </p>]]></text>
